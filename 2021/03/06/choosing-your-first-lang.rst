Choosing your first programming language
========================================

.. tags:: programming, ama

A while back I opened an online form so that people could ask me anonymous
questions, and posted it on Twitter.  Then I forgot about it |--| until
today, when I was cleaning up my online docs, and saw quite a few questions
there, waiting to be answered. Oops!

One of them is the topic of this blog post: "What programming language
should I learn first?" |--| and I'll try my best to reply to other questions
as I find some time to write it here.

Choosing your first programming language is a very daunting task,
especially today in this interconnected world.

When I started out, I didn't have many options: all I had was the
manual for my computer, which taught me the fundamentals of the BASIC
programming language. My school didn't have computer classes; none of
my school mates programmed in anything; I had no adults to ask
questions about computers in general, let alone programming.  It was
just me and that book.  It wasn't easy, but I was entranced.

Over time, my father saw that I was getting interested in programming
and got me every book he could find in the university library that was
about to be discarded for that programming language |--| `BASIC
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC>`_,
especially of the old, 8-bit kind, was already obsolete at the time and
not taught anymore at the university he lectured at |--| so I ended up
having more references.  Those books were for other variants of BASIC,
which are similar but not exactly compatible with the one my computer
had.  I learned early on to focus more on the problem being solved,
not on exactly how the program has to be written in order for the
computer to understand.

Things are very different today, and I wouldn't recommend anybody to
trail the same path I did; however, the takeway from this little anecdote
from my childhood stands: you'll very likely have to learn more than
one programming language in your programming career, so choosing one
programming language over the other as your first language isn't as
much of a big decision as you might think.

Find your niche
===============

Still, there are a no number of programming languages out there.  I'd
recommend, before even looking at a list |--| whatever list it is |--| try
to figure out what kinds of things you'd like to build.  Many |--| if not
all |--| of the modern, mainstream programming languages, are quite
capable and can be used to solve a multitude of problems.  Some of
them, however, tend to do really well in some specific niches, so
determining the kind of things you want to build is the first crucial
step.

Even if you narrow down your search to just a handful of options,
you're probably going to have a hard time picking one.  The websites
and documentation of many programming languages&related tools often do
mention characteristics and features that will be, at this point,
completely alien to you.

Find your people
================

And that's why you should look at another thing: the community around a
programming language.  There are many vibrant, helpful, welcoming
communities around programming languages out there.  They provide
discussion forums, documentation, examples, tutorials, guided tours,
videos, conferences, chat rooms, and a whole lot of information I could
only dream as a kid back in the early 90s.

Finding one where you feel welcomed is maybe the second most important thing
you can do while picking your first programming language.  You'll have
questions, you'll be stuck, you'll want to share what you're working on; the
community will most likely have your back and help you on your journey. 
(It's important to note that many of these communities are self-organized by
volunteers, donating their free time to its betterment.  Be kind,
respectful, and once you're confident enough, pay it forward: others will
come after you and they'll appreciate this.)

Unfortunately, not all programming languages have a community
around them, let alone one that welcomes novices.  On one hand,
this might hinder your search for your first language if there's
not much overlap between a healthy community and the language of
choice of your particular niche of interest.  On the other hand,
choosing a language with a healthy community will increase your
chances of success so if you're struggling in this step, you might
want to reconsider the first step |---| at least for your first
language.

Find your second language
=========================

Now that you picked your programming language, wrote a few programs, and
participated in a community, I would highly recommend you learning a second
programming language.  I assure you that it'll be a lot easier this time
around, and that it'll only get easier as you learn other programming
languages.  The hard part will continue to be how to break down a large
program into manageable pieces that you can fit in your head, and once you
learn two or three programming languages, they don't really matter as much
anymore.

TL;DR
=====

To recap, my recommendation here is to:

- Find what you want to do; try to not be too ambitious at first, though
- Figure out which languages people often use for that
- Find the community for that language and take a look around

And, more importantly, "lather, rinse, repeat".

Closing thoughts
================

Before I forget: it's absolutely fine to not learn a new
programming language for a good while |--| even if it's your first,
second, or 10th |--| there's no need to rush or learn things just to
learn things.  Solving problems and making things is what you're
looking for, and it just so happens that many systems today are written
in a mixture of languages for a variety of reasons.

Last, but certainly not least: if you're not a native English speaker,
consider learning it as your second programming language.  Yes, I said that
English is a programming language: it's not because you can program
computers with it, but because, for better or for worse, it is the de facto language
used by computer scientists and software engineers to share
information and interact with each other online and offline.  Even though you might find
great resources in your native language |--| and I completely see the irony
that this blog post is not written in my native language, Brazilian
Portuguese |--| you'll not only be missing out on a lot of good materials
and interactions, you'll also risk only having to work with terrible
translations that mislead and misinform you.  There are
exceptions, of course, but as you move forward in your path, this is
definitely something you want to invest some time in.  (By the way, if you
end up liking this blog post enough to translate it to your native language,
please send me a link, I'll update this post with it here.)
