Converting GW-BASIC to the Z80
==============================

.. tags:: programming, z80, assembly, retrocomputing

Right after the BUILD conference, Microsoft `released the source code
for the first version of GW-BASIC for the MS-DOS under the MIT license
<https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/microsoft-open-sources-gw-basic/>`_.
Not only this is an improved version of the very first product that
kickstarted the company, it's also the base for my first programming
language, the `MSX BASIC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX_BASIC>`_.

Needless to say, I was stoked to see this release, and decided to take
a look |---| it's a historic artifact that's very close to home.  To my
surprise, I noticed that many of the comments were referencing the
Intel 8080 registers and not the Intel 8086 registers.  The reason for
this is that these sources were translated mechanically by a tool written
in the 80s; that's why there were many versions of the Microsoft BASIC
for home computers in that era, despite the variety in CPU instruction
set architectures available at the time.

.. code:: asm

    ;
    ; FIND A "FOR" ENTRY ON THE STACK WITH THE VARIABLE POINTER
    ; PASSED IN [D,E].
    ;
    PUBLIC  FNDFOR
    FNDFOR: MOV     BX,OFFSET 4+0   ;IGNORING EVERYONES "NEWSTT"   
                                    ;AND THE RETURN ADDRESS OF THIS
            ADD     BX,SP           ;SUBROUTINE, SET [H,L]=SP

(Note in the fragment above that ``BX`` is used as one of the arguments for
``ADD``, although ``H`` and ``L`` are referenced in the comment.  It also
mentions ``D`` and ``E``, which are Z80/8080 registers.  This kind of
comment was helpful in determining the register mapping between 8086 and
Z80.  More details below.)

All assembly source files contain a comment in the first line referencing
this instruction set conversion tool, which wasn't unfortunately open
sourced (for reasons I don't know):

.. code:: asm

    ; [ This translation created 10-Feb-83 by Version 4.3 ] 

Naturally, this intrigued me and I decided to port this back to the Z80
(which is compatible, on a machine code level, with the Intel 8080), with
the intention of running it on a `MSX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX>`_
(or a `RC2014 <https://rc2014.co.uk/>`_).  And, of course, instead of converting
the whole source code from 8086 assembly into Z80 assembly manually, I decided to write
a tool to perform (most) of the conversion.

Although my first computer had a Z80 processor, I never had a chance to
actually write any Z80 code; so this has been an interesting experience.
Luckily, I played quite a bit with the MS-DOS ``debug.com``, so some things,
such as the 8086 segmented memory model, wasn't that alien to me.

The Conversion Tool
===================

The conversion tool works pretty much like a compiler.

It's written in Python and is set up as a pipeline, with 4 components: the
lexer, the parser, the transformer, and the writer.  (I'm currently
refactoring the converter to have another component, that will sit between the
transformer and the writer, and which sole purpose will be to transform 8086
tokens into Z80 tokens, in such as way that it's consistent and
error-checked; the writer step will only care about producing assembly output
in the syntax of a particular Z80 assembler.)

Each component is a generator, yielding a token whenever they're done munching
their input.

Lexer
-----

The lexer works in a way that's very similar to `the way I've been writing lexers for
quite a while now </posts/2017/03/01/parsing_json.html>`_, so there's not much surprise
there.

Parser
------

The parser is a traditional recursive descent parser.  It's a trivial implementation
for one, but there's quite a bit of logic to handle some special cases found only in
the GW-BASIC code base.  Mainly, a Python implementation of the ``MOVRI`` and ``INS86``
macros:

- The ``INS86`` macro is used to generate assembly instructions that were
  not supported by the assembler used at the time.  It's heavily used
  throghout the code base, with over 120 uses.  The parameters are either
  numeric opcode names (usually in octal base), or reference to a symbol, with
  up to 4 parameters (e.g. ``INS86 62, 344`` for ``XOR AH, AH``).  The parser will
  convert the instruction bytes to actual 8086 mnemonics so the next pass in
  the pipeline can more easily convert them to Z80 instructions.

  The ``rasm2`` tool from the `radare <https://rada.re/n/>`_ project was really
  useful in decoding these instructions.  For instance, calling it with ``rasm2 -d  -a x86 -b 16 d3ea``
  in the command line will provide the decoded instruction, ``shr dx, cl``.  Padding
  the instructions with ``00`` (or any other value) will help in cases where ``INS86``
  was called with half a instruction and directives such as ``DB`` (define byte) were
  used right after it.  The conversion tool will print out the code in hexadecimal when
  the arguments are unknown in the same way that ``rasm2`` expects for this reason.

- The ``MOVRI`` macro is used to initialize the ``CX`` and ``DX`` registers. It's
  not clear why it's necessary (and why they couldn't just use ``MOV CX, ...`` instead),
  but I'm going to assume that it's a remnant of previous efforts to port the code
  from the original 8080 assembly into other ISAs, before the automated tool existed.

It also performs some tasks, such as removing macros that are known to not
be used anywhere in the code (and which used instructions that were not
supported by the converter), parses instruction arguments (so numbers are
numbers, in the correct base, etc.), and a few other similar tasks.

Most other tokens are forwarded unmodified to the next step.

Transformer
-----------

This step does some pattern matching and tries to convert some series of
8086 instructions into a series of either Z80 instructions, or some
high-level instruction that the last step is able to generate as Z80
instructions.

In order to preserve the source code comments (which are the most important
thing in this particular historical artifact), each token from the parser is
annotated by the transformer to include a monotonically-increasing numerical
identifier.

The pattern matching works by looking at the instruction stream with windows
of increasing size, and ignoring tokens that aren't instructions or labels:

.. code:: python

    tokens = list(token for token in tokens if token['type'] in {'label', 'instruction'})

    # ...

    for window in windowed(tokens, 2):
        # ...
        matched = self._match(window, ({'JZ', 'JAE', 'JB', 'JS', 'JNZ', 'JNAE', 'JNB', 'JNS'}, (('SHORT', '$+3'),)), ('RET', ()))
        if matched:
            fill_dict(matched, {'op': 'ret_' + self.inverted_jumps[matched[0]['op']], 'operands': ()})
            continue
        # ...

The ``_match()`` function takes a window (as calculated by the ``itertools.windowed()``
function), and a matching pattern to look at. If the window matches the pattern, it
returns the window; otherwise, it returns None so the next call to ``_match()`` can have
a try at looking at that window.

The matching pattern accepted by the ``_match()`` function is quite powerful.  It's a
N-tuple (one element for each element in the window it's supposed to match against),
containing a pair of instruction and tuple-of-operands).  Instructions or operands
can be defined as:

- String: will match that exactly. For example, ``('DEC', ('CH',))`` will match ``DEC CH`` exactly
- Set: any of those will be matched. For example, ``({'DEC', 'DECB'}, ('CH',)`` will match either ``DEC`` or ``DECB``, with the ``CH`` argument
- None: Anything will be matched. For example, ``('JMP', ('SHORT', None))`` will match a short jump to any target

If none of the token IDs are in the transformation dictionary, the
``fill_dict()`` function will first mark all tokens to be deleted from the
stream; then, iterate over its arguments and store the updated token
information.  (The step to mark tokens to be removed from the stream is
necessary for transformations that are shorter than the window size.)

With the transformation dictionary, the transformer step can just go through
it and, if the token ID is in the dictionary, it can either delete it (but
emit a "comment" token if that token had one in the first place), or mutate
the current token before emitting it to the next step.

It took a lot of trial, error, and looking through the whole code and the
Z80 instruction set, to find patterns and things that could be improved in
the "backwards translation" of the GW-BASIC source code.  This thing ended
up being slightly complex, but complex enough to match and transform all
patterns that I could find that required transformation of more than a
single instruction at a time.  As I learned more about the Z80 capabilities,
such as conditional ``CALL`` or ``RET`` instructions, some patterns began to
emerge and this step got some much needed refinement.

The last step is generating the Z80 code.

One of the first things I did to implement this step was figuring out the
register mapping between 8086 and Z80.  Guided by the comments still
referencing the Intel 8080 comments (which have the same names as the Z80
registers), and by the assumption that the original translation tool worked
on an instruction-by-instruction basis rather than some sofisticated
analysis mechanism, this wasn't a terribly difficult task.

On the right there's a table summarizing this initial work.  In order to
produce this table, some unknowns had to be resolved; it had to do with some
of these registers, mainly ``SI``, ``DI``, ``AH``, and ``AX``:

- ``SI`` and ``DI`` do not have a Intel 8080 equivalent, but Z80 has ``IX`` and ``IY``.
  While they're not that efficient to work with, for the purposes of GW-BASIC,
  they worked like a charm.  Even if I had to resort to some of the `not-officially-documented
  Z80 instructions <http://www.z80.info/z80undoc.htm>`_.

- The Z80 equivalent of ``AX`` is ``AF``, but it isn't a general-purpose
  register: ``F``, the low part of ``AF``, stores the CPU flags, unlike ``AL``
  in the Intel 8086.  The 8086 ``AH`` register was also used in the code, so I
  had to do something about it.

  Luckily, usages of both ``AH`` and ``AX`` followed a pattern that I was
  eventually able to recognize (either from the comments, or by recognizing the
  instruction patterns), and emit Z80 instructions to save/restore the flags
  using either the Z80 instructions ``EX AF, AF'`` (exchange ``AF`` with its
  prime register, ``AF'``), or ``PUSH AF`` and ``POP AF`` (leveraging the
  stack) depending on the case.

  On the same note, all uses of ``AL`` that I could find ended up matching the
  purpose of Z80's ``A`` register.  Quite a bit of 8086 code ends up ferrying
  data from other registers to the ``AL`` register (and back) even though the
  processor was perfectly capable of doing that |--| because the 8080 (and the
  Z80) couldn't perform these operations unless the data was already in the
  ``A`` register.  This finding corroborates the idea that the original
  Microsoft translation tool didn't perform any kind of advanced analysis and
  worked primarily on an instruction-by-instruction basis.

In this step, Z80 instructions are generated one-by-one, possibly like the original
code translation tool used to do.  Primitive validation is performed |--| although at
the moment, some invalid Z80 instructions might be generated, and some of them are
still stubbed out |--| aborting the conversion tool so that unhandled cases can be
implemented before moving forward.  Since this is a purpose-built tool, I can get away
with not implementing every nook and cranny of Intel 8086 instructions: only the things
that are actually needed by GW-BASIC.

For instance, the code to generate the Z80 equivalent of the 8086 ``ROR``
(rotate right) instruction is the following:

.. code:: python

    def _gen_instruction_ror(self, token):
        assert len(token['operands']) == 2
        op1, op2 = token['operands']
        if op2 == 1:
            if op1 == 'AL':
                return 'RRA'
            if not self._is_16bit_reg(op1) and op1 in self.regmap:
                return 'RR %s' % self.regmap[op]
            if op1 == '[BX]':
                return 'RR (HL)'  
        raise SyntaxError("Don't know how to generate ROR with op %s, %s" % (op1, op2))

It'll only recognize uses of the ``ROR`` instruction that is used in the original
code.  It makes sense that it's a very limited subset and that many instructions
have a trivial conversion implementation such as this one: the original code was meant
to execute in the target processor.

This theme repeated over and over again until most source files that
implement the platform-neutral parts of the GW-BASIC interpreter could be
converted |--| barring validation, of course.  The generator needs to be
fine-combed, either through careful code review, or trying to assemble it
and fixing potential errors.

Files that can't yet be converted are those that implement platform-specific
glue code, specifically routines to control the IBM-PC hardware (either
using BIOS interrupts, reprogramming the `PIT
<https://wiki.osdev.org/Programmable_Interval_Timer>`_, or accessing video
or input devices), or invokes MS-DOS interrupts, and these would have to be
implemented by hand anyway.

Stubbed out instructions are those that perform operations not available in
Z80 processors, such as multiplication, division, or memory copies. 
Subroutines will need to be implemented for those in a way that's compatible
with the GW-BASIC usage, and will happen sometime after most of the Z80 code
can be assembled.  A curious fact is that the 8086 version still carries
macros implementing some Z80 instructions for the 8080, like ``LDIR`` and
``DJNZ`` |--| which are stripped by the conversion tool.  For instance,
here's an excerpt from ``OEM.H``:

.. code:: asm

    ;*******************************************************************
    ; Z80 related macros
    ;*******************************************************************
            Z80=1                   ;FOR VERSION THAT RUNS ON BOTH
                                    ;8080'S AND ZILOG Z-80'S
            Z80MAC=1                ;USE 8080 MACROS INSTEAD OF Z80 INSTRUCTIONS
            Z80=0
            Z80=1
    LDIR    MACRO
            MOV     WORD PTR A,WORD PTR M
            STAX    D
            INXF    H
            INXF    D
            DCXF    B
            MOV     WORD PTR A,WORD PTR B
            ORA     C
            JNZ     _-8D
    ENDM

(Macros being defined to different values in succession is a common pattern,
and believed to be artifact of the original conversion tool; the main source
code, where these are derived from, probably contains chunks of code between
these assignments.  It also probably means that the Microsoft Assembler
lazily-parses macros, because those instructions do not exist in 8086.)

Thanks to
=========

Sites such as `MAP <http://map.grauw.nl/resources/z80instr.php>`_, `Z80
Heaven <http://z80-heaven.wikidot.com/>`_, and `this table detailing how
each set of flags are used by each conditional jump instruction
<http://marin.jb.free.fr/jumps/>`_, were immensely helpful.  A few other
sites, such as the `CPC Tech <http://cpctech.cpc-live.com/docs/mult.html>`_
page, or `WikiTI
<https://wikiti.brandonw.net/index.php?title=Calculator_Documentation>`_ had
some wonderful tips that helped me map the 8086 instructions to Z80, and gave
me a few ideas on how to implement instructions such as ``IMUL`` or ``IDIV``.

I also happen to have some deadtree books at home, including the original
Intel manual for the 8086 and a book for Z80 programming targeting the MSX
(although it doesn't really mention the non-documented instructions, of
which some were useful in writing this converter), which were less helpful.
Lack of ``Ctrl+F`` isn't helpful for this kind of documentation.

Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to thank in no particular order,
people like Ricardo Bittencourt, Daniel Caetano, Giovanni Nunes, and Piter
Punk for the help when I was tweeting about this.

Current State and Closing Notes
===============================

The converter tool can do a lot of work already, but it's not complete.  I did
pause the work on it for a while due to personal reasons, but as I mentioned before,
it's being refactored to have an intermediate step between the Transformer and Writer
steps, which should reduce some of the churn when addressing bugs due to invalid Z80
instructions being generated.

Some work has been also being made in other forks of the GW-BASIC source code, where
`people are trying to build it using either older versions of the Microsoft Assembler
and Linker, or using more modern tooling such as JWAsm and JWLink <https://github.com/tkchia/GW-BASIC>`_.  Some of the code
to make the interpreter work is missing, but it's mostly platform-specific glue code,
which is being either reimplemented from the scratch, or reverse-engineered from the
(binary-only) ``BASICA.COM`` code that was released previously under the MIT license.

Some of the missing symbols had names that were suspicious to me, and,
indeed, `many of them were actually names of BIOS functions from the MSX
<https://github.com/dspinellis/GW-BASIC/issues/4#issuecomment-634755754`>_. 
Considering that Microsoft designed the BIOS in those computers, it's not
really surprising.  (It's good, too, because I wouldn't need to reimplement
those things if I ever get this to work on the MSX.)

My idea, eventually, is to use this as a base for a BASIC interpreter in the
`C-BIOS <http://cbios.sourceforge.net/>`_ project, which is an open source BIOS for the MSX computers.  It
currently lacks the BASIC component, and using one that's essentially the
same that shipped with the MSX would be a good starting step.  Of course, a
lot of the hardware-specific things, such as the ``PLAY`` command (which has
3 channels in the MSX, and is extensible to use FM synthethizers and
whatnot), general extensibility via hooks in ROMs attached to the computer,
and many other MSX-specific routines will need to be implemented.  I'm not
really worried about all this, however, as I'll be happy if all I can do in the
end is fill the screen with the output of the quintessential BASIC Hello, World:

.. code:: plain

    10 ? "Hello, world! ";
    20 GOTO 10

This work is open source and I `appreciate help if this is the kind of rabbit
hole you'd like to burrow in <https://github.com/lpereira/gw-basic>`_.
